* `applicant`: User; May NOT be NULL.\
  The inforequest owner, the user who submitted it.
* `email_set`: List of E-mail Messages; through Inforequest E-mails; May be empty; Ordered by
  processed date.\
  List of all inbound and outbound messages related to the inforequest, decided or undecided. The
  `unique_email` address generated for the inforequest is used for communication with all obligees
  the request was advanced to. It is up to the applicant ~~and/or some heuristics~~ to decide to
  which branch the action contained in the e-mail belongs. The e-mails are ordered by the date we
  sent or received them, respectively. Queued outbound e-mails waiting to be sent are ordered by
  their id.

  Every inforequest has a unique e-mail address of the form \*@mail.chcemvediet.sk. This address is
  used to identify which obligee e-mail belongs to which inforequest. However, if the inforequest
  was advanced to other obligees, the same e-mail address is used for communication with all such
  obligees, as there is no way to tell them to send their response to a different e-mail address.
* `submission_date`: Date; May NOT be NULL.\
  The effective date of the request action.

## Events

### Received E-mail

Trigger: Received inbound e-mail.

When an inbound e-mail is received, we assign the e-mail to an inforequest according to the e-mail
recipient address and the inforequest unique e-mail address. If there is no such inforequest, we
leave the received e-mail unassigned. The administrator can see a list of all unassigned inbound
e-mails.

If the assigned request is opened, we send a notification to the inforequest applicant. If there are
more undecided e-mails waiting in the inforequest, the applicant is informed about it. The
notification contains a link where the applicant may decide the received e-mails.

If the assigned inforequest is closed, no notification is sent. The administrator can see a list of
all undecided e-mails assigned to closed inforequests.

### Undecided E-mail Reminder

Trigger: Daily at 9:00

For every opened inforequest with a newest undecided raw e-mail received 5 WD ago, we send a
notification to its applicant to remind him about the undecided e-mails. The notification contains
a link where the applicant may decide the received e-mails.

### Obligee Deadline Reminder

Trigger: Daily at 9:00

For every opened inforequest with no waiting undecided e-mails, and every its branch which latest
action sets an obligee deadline, which was missed today taking into account all deadline extensions
made by its applicant, we send a reminder to its applicant to remind him about the expiring
deadline. The notification contains information about the action which deadline was missed and a
link where the applicant may act or extend the deadline. If an extended deadline is missed again, we
send the reminder again.

The following actions set obligee deadlines:
* Applicant Actions: Request, Clarification Response, Appeal
* Obligee Actions: Confirmation, Extension, Remandment
* Implicit Actions: Advanced Request


### Applicant Deadline Reminder

Trigger: Daily at 9:00

For every opened inforequest with no waiting undecided e-mails, and every branch which latest action
sets an applicant deadline, which is about to be missed in 2 WD, we send a reminder to its applicant
to remind him about the expiring deadline. The notification contains information which action
deadline is about to be missed and a link where the applicant may act.

The following actions set applicant deadlines: Clarification Request, Disclosure, Refusal.

### Close Inforequests

Trigger: Daily at 9:00

We close all inforequests that have all their branches terminated or abandoned. A branch is
abandoned if its latest action sets a deadline which was already missed at least 100 WD ago.

Just before we close an inforequest, we add an implicit expiration or appeal expiration action to
every its branch which latest action sets an obligee deadline. If the original latest action was an
appeal action, we add an appeal expiration action. Otherwise, we add an expiration action.

If there are any undecided e-mails in the closed inforequest, the administrator can see them in a
list of all undecided e-mails assigned to closed inforequests.

## User Actions

### Decide Undecided E-mail

URL: `/en/inforequests/decide-email/<action>/<inforequest_id>/<email_id>/`

Conditions:
* User is authenticated.
* User is the inforequest applicant.
* The inforequest is not closed.
* There is no older undecided e-mail in the inforequest.

The applicant decides if the received raw e-mail is related to the inforequest, and if so, he
decides which obligee action the e-mail represents. As advanced branches share their e-mail
addresses with their main branches, all raw e-mails are associated to the inforequest only. It is up
to the applicant ~~and/or some heuristics~~ to decide to which branch the action contained in the
received e-mail belongs.

The applicant may say that he doesn't know how to decide the received e-mail, for instance if he
does not know what this e-mail is. The administrator can see a list of e-mails  the users didn't
know how to decide.

If there are multiple undecided e-mails in the inforequest, the applicant must decide them in the
order they were received. After a raw e-mail is decided it's marked as decided and the corresponding
obligee action is added to the branch. If the applicant decides the received e-mail is unrelated to
the inforequest, no action is added to the branch, but the received e-mail is marked as unrelated
instead.

Only the following actions may be received by e-mail:
* **Confirmation**
* **Extension**: The applicant may input custom obligee deadline specified in the obligee response.
  If there is no custom obligee deadline in the response, the default deadline is used.
* **Advancement**: After this action is added, new advanced branches containing implicit advanced
  request actions are created. While the obligee may advance the inforequest to multiple new
  obligees, multiple new advanced branches may be created. It's up to the applicant to input the
  list of all obligees to which the request advanced. The inforequest may not be advanced to the
  same obligee, nor to two identical obligees. As this action may contain part of the requested
  information disclosed, the applicant should input if any of the information was disclosed or not.
* **Clarification Request**
* **Disclosure**: The applicant should input if the requested information was disclosed to the full
  extent, only partially, or not at all. If he says the information was fully disclosed, the branch
  is terminated.
* **Refusal**: The applicant should input the reason why the information was refused to disclose.

The created action received e-mail is set to the received e-mail and its subject, content and list
of uploaded files is copied. The effective date of the action received by e-mail is the date the

  applicant should input if any of the information was disclosed or not.

is missed as well, the applicant gets a notification about it.

The following actions set obligee deadlines that can be extended:

well, and vice versa. It's up to the applicant to decide.~~ If he decides to send it by s-mail, he
should be able to print ~~and/or download a pdf of~~ the prepared action content.

The obligee may respond from different e-mail addresses during the inforequest branch. To ensure the
clarification response is sent to the correct obligee address, it is sent to all e-mail addresses
collected during this branch. However not to addresses collected from other inforequest branches, as
every branch represents communication with different obligee.

The applicant may save the clarification response as a draft and send it later. There may be only
one clarification response draft in the inforequest. If the conditions change while the applicant
edits the clarification response, and it is not possible to send it any more, the clarification
response is not sent, but the applicant may save it as a draft and send it later. For instance, this
may happen if a new raw e-mail is received while the applicant edits the clarification response. In
such case, he must decide the received e-mail foremost.

The effective date of a clarification response is the date it was sent if it was sent by e-mail, or
the date it was generated if it was sent by s-mail.

automatically forward it to its superior. The applicant should be able to print ~~and/or download
a pdf of~~ the prepared action content.

If the appeal is sent after an obligee deadline was missed, an implicit expiration action is added
just before the appeal action.

The applicant may save the appeal as a draft and send it later. There may be only one appeal draft
in the inforequest. If the conditions change while the applicant edits the appeal, and it is not
possible to send it any more, the appeal is not sent, but the applicant may save it as a draft and
